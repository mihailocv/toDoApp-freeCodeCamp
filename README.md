# To Do App - freeCodeCamp

This project is part of the "JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures" certification on the freeCodeCamp platform.

## Project Description

Local storage is a web browser feature that lets web applications store key-value pairs persistently within a user's browser. This allows web apps to save data during one session, then retrieve it in a later page session.

In this TODO application, you'll learn how to handle form inputs, manage local storage, perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on tasks, implement event listeners, and toggle UI elements.

## Features

- Add new tasks with a title, date, and description.
- Edit existing tasks.
- Delete tasks.
- Persist tasks using local storage.
- Responsive design for different screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript


## Usage

- Click the "Add New Task" button to open the task form.
- Fill in the task details and click "Add Task" to save the task.
- Click the "Edit" button on a task to edit its details.
- Click the "Delete" button on a task to remove it.
- If you try to close the task form with unsaved changes, a confirmation dialog will appear.
